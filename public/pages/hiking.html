		<img src="images/7_falls_2.jpg" alt="Seven Falls" width="550" height="250">
		<p>7 falls is a moderatley intense hike located in Sabino Canyon just next door to Tucson. With a distance of over 8
		miles this hike is surely a day long activity that will not dissapoint. Hikers who find themselves making it to the end
		of the trail will quickly notice what it is named for as they approach the seven stacked waterfalls located at the end. On a hotter
		day, dont be afraid to bring a swimsuit! Because some travelers even like to swim in the resevoirs underneath the falls.</p>

		<img src="images/elden.jpg" alt="elden lookout" width="550" height="250">
		<p>Elden trail tends to be a more intense hike then some of the previous options mentioned on this list. This 
		is due to increases and decreases of elevation throughout the hike. Coming in at only 2.67 miles the hike may
		seem rather simple, but do not be misguided as the steep trails can quickly wear people out. Hikers who make it to the top
		will be greeted by a gorgeous view of flagstaff that you can hardly find anywhere else.</p>

		<p>Broken Arrow trail could be considered one of the easiest hikes on this list. Where the hiker travels through 
		gorgeous red rock for a majority of the hike. This area is also popular for jeep tours where visitors can traverse
		the terrain of the redrocks inside jeeps for a more relaxed experience with all the same views. As well as jeep tours this trail
		tends to be popular with mountain biking communities, so if you've been meaning to get that bike out of the garage this summer, this is the spot to take it!</p>

		<img src="images/fatmans.jpg" alt="fatmans pass" width="550" height="250">
		<p>Named a bit ironically, fatmans pass is one of the most famous hikes in Arizona. Known for a portion where Hikers
		will have to squeeze themselves through a moderatley tight crevice, this hike certainly isnt for those scared of tight spaces. The Trail
		is 3.8 miles there and back and is rather standard elevation most of the way. Located in South Mountain this hike is one most anyone
		can do and have fun while doing.</p>
